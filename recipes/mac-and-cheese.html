                    Boil Macaroni
                   </strong>
                </h3>
                   <p> 
                    Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni until al dente, about 8 minutes.

                    For a thicker mac and cheese, double the amount of macaroni.
                   </p>

                    <strong>
                        Make a Roux
                    </strong>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    While the macaroni is cooking, go ahead and start on the roux. A roux is a thickening agent made of one part fat and one part flour that makes up the base of this creamy mac and cheese.

                <p>
                    Final Step
                </p>
                    Once the macaroni is finished cooking, drain and stir into cheese sauce until coated.
